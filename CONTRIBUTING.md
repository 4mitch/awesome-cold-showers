# Contribution Guidelines

## Adding to this List

All submissions should have the following format:

* **Title:** [Title of thing, with link to thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWOY6uu3VUo)

* **Hype:** "The hyped claim or topic being addressed. You can be informal here, but don't be snide."

* **Shower:** The counter-claim, specified well. It should explain why this thing is rigorous enough for inclusion. For example, it has benchmarks, it carefully dissects the claim, it cites research, etc.

* **Caveats:** Any limitations to the thing. For example, it's old, it doesn't address a specific part of a claim, it has threats to validity, etc.

* **Notes:** Anything else you think is important to include.

If any of this seems unclear to you, check out the existing list for examples of what it should look like.

Not everything is appropriate for this list. Some of the reasons a contribution might be rejected:

* The thing isn't freely accessible.
* Not programming-related.
* It's not addressing an overhyped claim. If it's being a cold shower to [COBOL on Cogs](www.coboloncogs.org/HOME.HTM), it probably doesn't belong.
* It doesn't actually address the hype.
* It's not rigorous enough. Abstract arguments don't count as rigorous: it has to at least show specified issues or include examples. [This](https://hillelwayne.com/post/right-tool/) is a very rough guide to what I'm thinking of.
* It's incorrect or deceptive.
* It's formatted in a way that makes reading it extremely difficult.
* It's snide, obnoxious, angry, or just assholish in general.

Ultimately, everything here is a judgement call, so please don't mail me glitter bombs if I reject your PR.

## Getting Something off the List
